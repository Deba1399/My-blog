  <h1>The Journey Begins</h1>
  <p>Once upon a time, in a small village 2025 — the year everything I planned fell apart.
I had dreams… clear, focused, and full of hope.
I gave my heart to goals, to love, to people
But life had other plans.
What I built with so much belief… collapsed.
What I thought was certain… disappeared.
I failed in my career, I lost in love,
And somewhere along the way, I lost myself too.Everything went wrong — not just outside, but inside me.This pain, this silence, this mental weight… it’s real.
I never thought I’d feel this broken.
But even now, with all that’s gone wrong —
I’m still breathing, still standing, still hoping.
And maybe… just maybe… that’s where the healing begins.
