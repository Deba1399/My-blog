  <h1>The Journey Begins</h1>

  <p>Once upon a time, in a small village…</p>

  <p><strong>2025 — the year everything I planned fell apart.</strong></p>

  <p>I had dreams… clear, focused, and full of hope.<br>
  I gave my heart to goals, to love, to people.<br>
  But life had other plans.</p>

  <p>What I built with so much belief… collapsed.<br>
  What I thought was certain… disappeared.</p>

  <p>I failed in my career, I lost in love,<br>
  And somewhere along the way, I lost myself too.</p>

  <p>Everything went wrong — not just outside, but inside me.<br>
  This pain, this silence, this mental weight… it’s real.</p>

  <p>I never thought I’d feel this broken.<br>
  But even now, with all that’s gone wrong —</p>

  <p><strong>I’m still breathing, still standing, still hoping.</strong></p>

  <p>And maybe… just maybe… that’s where the healing begins.</p>
